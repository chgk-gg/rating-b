The top directories are:

* dj -- core Django files.
You need to create here private_settings.py with these constants:
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY (it can be any string)
DJANGO_POSTRGES_DB_NAME
DJANGO_POSTRGES_DB_USER
DJANGO_POSTRGES_DB_PASSWORD
DJANGO_POSTRGES_DB_HOST
DJANGO_POSTRGES_DB_PORT

* b -- Django files specific for rating B model.
  * models.py contains the descriptions of all tables in `b` schema;
  * management/commands/ contains commands that run rating-related computations.

* scripts -- functions that actually read the data from DB, compute ratings, and flush the results to the DB, and tests for them.


COMMANDS FOR RATING:

First install Django 3.0+ with `pip install django` or any equivalent.

* `python manage.py import_release N` reads teams and players ratings for release_id N from API (e.g. 1443 stands for 2020-04-03 release)
  and dumps it to b.player_rating, b.team_rating and b.player_rating_by_tournament (top bonuses for each player).

* `python manage.py calc_all_releases [--first_to_calc=2021-09-09] [--verbose]` calculates all releases from first_to_calc until today.

* `python manage.py calc_release YYYY-MM-DD [--verbose]` reads previous release data from our DB (it must already exist)
  and creates new release for YYYY-MM-DD (this date must be Thursday for 2021+ and Friday for 2020-).
